# Steps to Train and Run this Model

## Setup the Environment
Ensure you have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

## Loading and Preprocessing the Data
You need to load the dataset and preprocess it before feeding it into the model.

## Training the Ensemble Model
We train an sequential model using Keras and Tensorflow and LSTM.

## Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the Model with Training and Testing Accuracy with Confusion Matrix
